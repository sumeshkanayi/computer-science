Linked list node is a struct with a data and pointer to next nodes' address 

struct node {
  int data ;
  struct node *next;
};


inserting  a node:
---------------------------
Complexity: 
push/Enqueue O(1)
insert at a position O(n)
Tarversal: O(n)
Deletion: O(n)
pop/dequeue:  O(1)

Stack:

Same as linked list

Push and pull from head

Q:
Enque:
1)Uses another variable called rear
2) You can think of Stack as something which grows towards front direction
3)Q towards rear
